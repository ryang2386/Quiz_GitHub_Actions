## Description
This tech quiz app is the perfect app to test your Python knowledge! Take the quiz today and learn your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to your skills in Python.

Also, the repo has two YAML files. One YAML file runs a Cypress test on the code when a pull request to the develop branch is initiated, and the other YAML file automatically deploys the app to Render when a pull request to the main branch is made.

## Installation
* Type "cd -directory-name" in your terminal to access the folder where the app is located.
* Type "npm run render-build" to install all the necessary packages and build the app in one step.
* Once built, type "npm run seed" to load the questions, choices, and answers.
* Afterward, the last step is to type "npm run develop" to deploy the app locally!

## Usage
This app can be used by anyone willing to learn more about tech and coding in general. Also, the tests run by the YAML files can be viewed on GitHub Actions. Here are some screenshots of what to expect when checking GitHub actions:

## Contribution
Columbia University Coding Bootcamp provided the code for the Tech Quiz to work. I created the YAML files to initiate Cypress tests when a pull request to the develop branch is made and to deploy the app to Render when a pull request to the main branch is made, thanks to help from Columbia Bootcamp and the research I've done on this topic. If you'd like to run more tests on the app, feel free to fork the repo and create a pull request. I'd like to see the other tests you can develop based on the code. Also, please give this app a star! I'd truly appreciate it!

## Tests
In the Usage section of this document are screenshots showing that the tests currently in the code have passed. If you'd like to test more components on the app, feel free to fork the repo.
